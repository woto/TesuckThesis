# Like a BoS
Today is June 28, 2011. Original post is located at my
[Balcone Koost](http://balcone.eveel.ru/post/7005465088/like-a-bos)
blog.

Today I have achieved Bachelor of Science degree by
creating keyphrase extraction system using Rubinius.
Title of my BoS thesis is
“Research and Development of
Automatic Keyphrase Extraction System from
Natural Language Text”.

Just enjoy my [Tesuçk](http://tesuck.eveel.ru), but at this
time it’s a deep &beta; software.

I will be very drunk today, tomorrow and until friday.
